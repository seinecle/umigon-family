# Shared data structures between umigon projects

Umigon is the name given to a coding project for sentiment analysis. With the project expanding, naming has changed and the initial codebase has been split to decouple different parts of the project.

umigon-model is the repo that contains the objects and other data structures that are used and shared between these different repos.

# To do
