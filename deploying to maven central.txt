increment the version to 1.3 (example) in parent pom
comment out all child modules in parent pom
run parent pom with mvn -Pparent
increment version in readme

make sure that there is only umigon-family in target/stage-deploy

in git CLI do:

git add *
git commit -m "deploying update to umigon family"
git tag v1.3 -a -m "1.3 tag for first release"
git push
git push origin v1.3

normally it should publish the parent pom directly!

Then:
WAIT 15 MINUTES
- uncomment the child modules in the parent pom
- update the version of the revision to 0.219 in the pom parent and the readme
- run parent pom with mvn -Prelease
- DELETE the parent pom folder in the stage-deploy folder

in git CLI:
git add *
git commit -m "deploying update to umigon family"
git tag v0.219 -a -m "219 tag for first release"
git push
git push origin v0.219
