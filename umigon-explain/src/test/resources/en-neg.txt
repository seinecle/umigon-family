I really like my bank. Not..
I don't like my job.
What a rude lady. Told me unless I'm a real customer I shouldn't be touching items how else are you suppose to read the price.
I donâ€™t think he really did a great job
Why are you so sad?
I really wanted to like this device. Great concept and can save you hundreds on Cable TV bills, but most recent changes basically broke the product, which used to be a more reliable device and better value for your money.--The positive--If you are into movies, already have a Netflix or you're an Amazon Prime subscriber and you don't have any game console at home, this is a great little device. For about 100 dollars and without any extra monthly payments, you will be able to enjoy tons of movies for free, even some important TV shows.The interface is relatively easy to use, but configuring channels require a PC. This is kind of annoying when you have to do that with several channels, wish you can do that directly with the console only, but once you passed that stage let's say there are no more extra steps or additional settings that you need to tweak.On the aesthetic side, is really small. The company also states it uses less power than previous model, but I honestly do not think that you will save thousands of dollars anyway; the biggest savings come from dropping your Cable TV service altogether.--The not so nice and what changed --Here's are the bad news. The firmware and software is buggy. I was watching Amazon on demand and the stuff restart twice. It happened several times and continue to happen, even after firmware upgrade. Something similar with Netflix. The "supported" channels take an eternity to load, like CNN. I understand that this device is basically a "man in the middle", just streaming the online content to your TV, but the previous model was much more stable (I sold it to get this one)But, If you are more into TV shows or live news, you are out of luck with Roku 2. Most of the unofficial channels do not work anymore: PlayOn, Plex, NokNok. Those basically allow you to watch local USA TV or CBS on your TV, via Roku. They were working on the previous model, for some weird reason (copyright issues or software problems) they no longer work on this one and no ETA of when is going to be fixed, maybe never, who knows.So in a nutshell. You will loose the capability of watch those unofficial channels I mentioned, some ports were removed, the box is smaller and uses less power, and gives you a higher resolution for some movies or show. Worth the money? I don't think so. You can do exactly the same (with the exception of games and getting a higher resolution) with the Roku 1. Hence, I don't see a reason to upgrade or buy the new one.This is a nice product but it is too buggy or the company started to loss its battle against major TV stations.By the way, I currently have a 12Mbps Internet connection. Not a T1 or Fiber Optic, but more than enough to handle HD video streamingBuy the previous model instead and enjoy while it last ... it is a shame that USA users are condemned to pay higher bills if we want live TV and good programming...** EDIT ***8/16/2011Bought the previous model again, which I sold by mistake. Run the setup, added PlayOn, it works!!! Time to sell Roku 2.People, this is one of those cases where new does not mean better or faster. Just one more comment, we can still have or get 1024 dpi resolution on previous model. Also, most channels are not providing anything higher than 740, so even in resolution you're not going to lose anything if you buy the previous model instead.I would probably take a look on Roku 2 on 6 months or so, when it gets a more stable firmware and patches.For those interested: my PlayOn runs on a Mac mini 2010. The Mac Mini has 8GB of RAM and I assigned 2GB to the virtual machine. The virtual machine runs Windows XP SP3 and the virtualization software is Parallels. I tried Virtual box but does not provide the performance PLayOn needs. ANSWERNOTFOUND
I just ordered a white pair from Amazon. Got them this past SaturdayI was really worried about the sound quality. I wanted them to listen to music and they do just that and sound pretty decent. There was one issue though.I charged them up and set them up to my ipad. While listening to music that was actually stored on the ipad the sound would just randomly cut out. I then connected it to my note 3 and played music from Pandora. It did the same thing and it was extremely random but frequent. I just sent an email Planttronics regarding this issue and to find out if this normal operation. I also googled the issue as well, it doesn't seem to be common but has happened with other headsets of theirs.I will report back after I hear from them.***EDIT***I got my replacement 2 days later. Charged both the headphones and the case. Paired with the ipad and my note 3 and boom, no more intermittent drops on sound. Crystal clear audio. Went to charge them with the case and now i have a different problem. The light on the headphones goes red for 2 seconds showing charging and then cuts out, while the light on the case that indicates the case is charged blinks and never charges the headphones. But the headphones charge when directly connected to the charger. Called Plantronics and they stated it was a defective case and are sending out a replacement case....4/24/14 update2nd update, I got the replacement case and still have the same issue. I got a replacement headphone order shipped to me from amazon and the sound is completely different in the new head set. The sound has way too much highs now and there is no bass. So I have another crappy set. With this much variation in product performance there is no quality control with on this headset and I will be calling Plantronics back as well as amazon to get this resolved.Maybe this is a rare occurrence and just my bad luck.

I was not particularly impressed with the character itself
no one would want their friend to be treated like that.
These figures are not completely reliable.
You simply don't want to understand
You would want me to believe you?
But the problem is, what is the truth? 
The staff was not welcoming the breakfast was practically insufcient and after 9am they did not
I am not glad of this
According to preliminary data, unfortunately, we have lost 137 of our heroes today - our citizens. 10 of them are officers. 316 are wounded
This seems kind of ridiculous now
Truth is the latest casualty when a debate lasts so long
